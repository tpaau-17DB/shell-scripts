shell-scripts

A collection of scripts I use to automate common tasks.

All of the scripts should run on any Unix-like OS  as long as you have the GNU
Core Utilities and Python 3 installed.

**Most** of my bash scripts already have dependency checks so even when you are
missing something, you will be politely asked to install the required program.

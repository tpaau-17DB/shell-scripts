git repo: https://github.com/tpaau-17DB/shell-scripts

A collection of scripts I use to automate common tasks.

## Requirements
All of the scripts should run on any Unix-like OS  as long as you have the GNU Core Utilities and Python 3 installed.

The specific requirements (if any) for each script are listed within the script itself.
